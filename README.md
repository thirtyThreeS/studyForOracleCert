# studyForOracleCert
Udemy - Java Programming Masterclass with Tim Buchalka

I am going to achieve the Oracle Certification for Java as most of the USA uses Java for work.

I figured I might as well upload my work (some of it at least) to track progress on GitHub.

Note: Some of the work may contain errors or bugs because I do sometimes finish the work in the browser instead of IntelliJ IDEA which is what I am using for this course.
